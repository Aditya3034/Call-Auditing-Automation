  "structured_transcript": "[00:00:00] Agent (calm, professional): Hello, thank you for calling Payone.  How can I assist you today?\n[00:00:08] Customer (distressed): I booked a flight for today, but there's been a death in the family.  Is there any process for cancelling the non-refundable ticket?\n[00:00:20] Agent (empathetic): I understand this is a difficult situation.  Did the passenger miss the flight?\n[00:00:25] Customer: No, the flight is at 10:15 am.  The passenger won't be able to travel.\n[00:00:30] Agent (professional):  Could I please have your call and registration number, and your PN number?\n[00:00:40] Customer: My PN number is IJUR7R. I booked yesterday.\n[00:00:45] Agent (professional): Thank you.  The travel date is 10:25 am, so there are approximately 2.5 hours remaining before departure. Unfortunately, this is a non-refundable ticket, meaning a cancellation won't result in a refund.  Date changes are also not possible.\n[00:01:15] Customer:  So there's absolutely no option for a refund, even with a family emergency?\n[00:01:20] Agent (sympathetic): I understand your frustration.  With less than 2.5 hours until departure, options are extremely limited. Even a no-show will likely result in charges.  \n[00:01:35] Agent (professional): Your best course of action is to contact Spyjet customer service directly to explain the situation and see if they offer any exception.  If they agree to a cancellation, you can then request a refund through the Payone portal.  Expect a refund processing time of 24-48 working hours, though some charges may still apply.\n[00:02:00] Agent (professional):  If Spyjet doesn't offer a cancellation, unfortunately, there will be no refund, and the passenger will have to remain at the airport.\n[00:02:15] Customer: Okay.\n[00:02:15] Agent (professional): Please contact Spyjet customer care.  If they grant a cancellation, make a record of that call. You can also email us at flightsupport@payone.in or use our live chat for updates; you’ll get a response within 2 minutes. Your flight resume number is 300; you’ll need this for any further inquiries.\n[00:02:50] Agent (professional):  Is there anything else I can assist you with today?\n[00:03:00] Customer: No, thank you.\n[00:03:02] Agent (professional): You're welcome. Thank you for calling Payone. Goodbye.\n\n**Key Action Items:**\n\n* Customer to contact Spyjet customer service directly.\n* If Spyjet cancels the flight, customer to request a refund via Payone portal (expect 24-48 hour processing).\n* Customer to keep a record of their call with Spyjet.\n* Alternative contact methods for updates provided: email (flightsupport@payone.in) and live chat.\n\n**Escalation:** None formally escalated, but the agent strongly suggested contacting the airline directly, understanding the limitations due to the short time frame before flight departure.\n",
  "title": "Non-Refundable Flight Cancellation Request Due to Family Emergency",
  "summary": "A customer called regarding a non-refundable flight booked through Payone (PN: IJUR7R) for a flight departing at 10:15 am. Due to a death in the family, the passenger was unable to travel.  The customer initially expressed distress and frustration about the non-refundable nature of the ticket. The agent, while empathetic, explained that due to the short timeframe before departure (approximately 2.5 hours remaining), a refund or date change was not possible through Payone. The agent advised the customer to contact Spyjet customer service directly to request a cancellation.  If Spyjet grants the cancellation, the customer can then request a refund through the Payone portal, with a processing time of 24-48 hours.  The agent also provided alternative contact methods for updates, including email (flightsupport@payone.in) and live chat. The call concluded with the customer understanding the process. No formal escalation occurred; however, the agent directed the customer to the airline for potential exception handling. The emotional tone shifted from the customer's initial distress and frustration to a more neutral understanding once the agent provided clear guidance on the available options, despite the negative outcome regarding the refund.",
